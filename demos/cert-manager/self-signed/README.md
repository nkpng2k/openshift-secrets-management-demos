# Self-Signed Demo

This is a simple demo using the `hello-openshift` container image
to consume a cert-manager generated tls certificate.

For the purposes of the demo, a self-signed CA is used in order
to limit dependencies on any other external entities. This is
NOT recommended for production environments, but solely to
provide an example of how to secure a running app with a tls
certificate generated by cert-manager via an Ingress resource.

## Prerequisites

Must have the following installed:
- `oc`
- `curl`
- `openssl` (optional) you can uncomment some code in `02_deploy_cert_manager_crds.sh` to run a simple test with openssl

## Steps

1. Make sure to have `oc` and `curl` installed
2. Make sure to log in with your admin credentials via `oc login` command
3. Run the scripts in order from the `src` folder:
```sh
# Installs cert-manager operator
./01_install_cert_manager_operator.sh

# Deploys cert-manager Issuer and Certificates needed for demo
# NOTE: can uncomment some code to run simple OpenSSL test
./02_deploy_cert_manager_crds.sh

# Deploys a sample deployment, service, and ingress
./03_deploy_example_application.sh

# Cleanup step. Tearsdown the resources created during the prior steps
./04_cleanup.sh
```

## Disclaimer

This is not guaranteed to work in all environments, and is meant to showcase
an extremely simple example of how an application's ingress can be secured
via tls certificates generated by cert-manager.
